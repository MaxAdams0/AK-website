        <h1>Swerve (Dis)Assembly Guide</h1>
        <div class="guide">
            This is a quick guide on how to disassemble and reassemble the swerve drives' wheels for replacement. Make 
            sure to replace these as often as possible during a match to ensure the robot has enough traction.

                Step 1: Remove the wheel from the swerve drive. There is one long
                black hex-screw which holds the wheel on.

                Step 2: Remove the shaft, washers, and spacers.

                Step 3: Take out the bearings on either side.

            </div>
            <span>
                Step 4: Remove the 6 hex bolts holding both the gear and flat plate mounts on the wheel. Make sure 
                when removing to use the asterisk-like pattern to remove screws, as shown by this kindergardener-level 
                drawing on the right.

            </div>
            <span>
                Step 5: Now that you have fully disassembled the wheel, get a new tire (the rubber part).
                Do a visual check when getting a new tire to see if it should be used. Tread? Good. Slick/Oily? Bad.
                You get the idea. Repeat the same steps backwards to reassemble. Make sure to put the gear plate 
                on first, line up the holes to the ones on the tire, put on the second (flat) plate, line up the holes, and 
                then insert the screws. Otherwise, the alignment gets all screwed up (punintended).

            </div>
            <span>
                Step 6: When reinserting the wheel into the swerve drive itself, find the gear side of the wheel (left),
                and align it with this gear shown in the swerve housing (right).

            </div>
            <span>
                Step 7: Finally, reinsert long hex screw from the first step. It can only go in on one side of the swerve, 
                which should be the one opposite of the gear.
